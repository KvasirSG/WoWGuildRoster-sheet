# WoWGuildRoster-sheet
- Author: Kenneth Heimann(KvasirSG)
- Created for: Dude Where is my mana (WoW Guild) [Formerly]

## Author's Note
I designed a googlesheet with GoogleScript and Blizzard WoW API to make an interactive WoW Raid Roster.
I did this in cooperation of the wow guild Dude Where is my mana of the server Kazzak til they ended the cooperation.

## How to make it work

1. Create a Google Sheet
2. Load in the [RaidRoster.csv](https://github.com/KvasirSG/WoWGuildRoster-sheet/blob/master/Raid%20Roster%20-%20Sheet1.csv) file.
3. Create a script from the google sheet editor
4. Paste the code of the [Code.gs](https://github.com/KvasirSG/WoWGuildRoster-sheet/blob/master/Code.gs) file.
5. Get an Blizzard API Key.
6. Relpace API_KEY with the API key

## Changes to the script
- I am working on a universal script for now the script only works for the kazzak guild.
